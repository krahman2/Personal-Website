            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a Graduate AI Research Assistant at AI-LAMP with 1+ year of experience in multimodal deep learning and Visual-to-Audio synthesis. 
              Currently pursuing my Master's in Statistical Data Science while teaching Calculus at SF State and K-8 mathematics at Descartes Learning Club, 
              I combine technical expertise with leadership experience to drive innovative solutions in AI and engineering.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              My journey began in Bangladesh, where I was born and raised with an appreciation for community and curiosity. 
              In my late teens, I moved to Malaysia, a transition that shaped my independence, adaptability, and worldview. 
              Eventually, I moved to the United States to pursue my passion for engineering and my ambition to make a larger impact.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I graduated Cum Laude from San Francisco State University in 2024 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Machine Learning. 
              During my undergraduate years, I served as IEEE Vice President, Engineering Student Advisory Board Secretary, and completed an IT Project Management 
              internship at Cencora (Fortune 20 pharmaceutical company). Currently pursuing my Master's in Statistical Data Science (Aug 2025 - Aug 2027), 
              I'm expanding my expertise in statistical analysis and data mining while conducting research at AI-LAMP and teaching mathematics. 
              I believe in leveraging technology to solve real-world problems while building strong communities and fostering collaboration across disciplines.
